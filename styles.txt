I'm Angela.
a programmer.

I am an iOS and Web Developer. I'm the founder and CTO of The App Brewery. I ❤️ coffee and brew my own beers.

Design & Development
I started learning to code when I was 12 years old because I wanted to make my own video games. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.

Hot Wings Challenge
But my best skill is actually in eating hot wings. I am the undisputed queen of hot wing challenges. Ghost Peppers and Carolina Reapers are my favourite snacks.
